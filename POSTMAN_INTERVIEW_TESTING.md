}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid-here",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "question-1-uuid",
      "question": "Tell me about a challenging full-stack project you led...",
      "category": "behavioral",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "tips": "Use STAR method",
      "expected_answer_focus": "leadership and technical skills"
    }
  ],
  "job_description": "Senior Full Stack Developer...",
  "difficulty": "medium", 
  "question_count": 5,
  "instructions": "Answer all questions, then use /api/interview/submit-all-answers/ to submit all answers for batch evaluation.",
  "flow": "batch_processing"
}
```

**üìù Save the `session_id` and question `id`s for the next step!**

## üìù Step 4: Submit All Answers for Batch Evaluation (NEW)

```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/interview/submit-all-answers/
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": "SESSION_ID_FROM_STEP_3",
  "answers": [
    {
      "question_id": "QUESTION_1_ID",
      "user_answer": "I led a team of 6 developers to build a microservices-based e-commerce platform. The main challenge was migrating from a monolithic architecture while maintaining zero downtime. I implemented a strangler fig pattern, gradually replacing components. We used Docker containers, Kubernetes for orchestration, and implemented CI/CD with Jenkins. The project took 8 months and resulted in 40% better performance and 60% faster deployment cycles."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "QUESTION_2_ID", 
      "user_answer": "For React state management, I choose based on complexity. For simple apps, I use useState and useContext. For medium complexity, I prefer Zustand for its simplicity. For large enterprise apps, I use Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for server state. I also implement proper memoization with useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "QUESTION_3_ID",
      "user_answer": "I mentor junior developers through code reviews, pair programming sessions, and weekly one-on-ones. I create learning paths based on their goals, assign progressively challenging tasks, and encourage them to present their solutions to the team. I also organize tech talks and maintain internal documentation. My approach focuses on building confidence while ensuring code quality."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "QUESTION_4_ID",
      "user_answer": "I handle production issues by first assessing severity and impact. For critical issues, I immediately notify stakeholders and implement temporary fixes if needed. I use monitoring tools like DataDog and Sentry to identify root causes. I document all incidents, conduct post-mortems, and implement preventive measures. Communication is key - I keep all stakeholders updated throughout the resolution process."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "QUESTION_5_ID",
      "user_answer": "I stay current through multiple channels: following tech blogs like Hacker News and Dev.to, attending conferences and webinars, participating in online communities, and working on side projects. I dedicate 2 hours weekly to learning new technologies. I also contribute to open source projects and maintain a learning journal to track my progress."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "session-uuid",
  "total_questions": 5,
  "total_evaluations": 5,

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "User not found"**

- **Solution**: Use the exact `session_id` returned from `/interview/questions/`

### **Issue: "FIREWORKS_API_KEY is not set"**
- **Solution**: Check environment variables in Django settings

### **Issue: "Model call failed"**
- **Solution**: Check Fireworks API key validity and network connection
